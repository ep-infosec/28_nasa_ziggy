# Ziggy Release Notes

These are the release notes for Ziggy. While we're able to provide links to GitHub issues, we are not able to provide links to our internal Jira issues.

## 0.2.0

This is the first Ziggy release to appear on GitHub. The major number of 0 indicates that we're still refactoring the Kepler and TESS codebases and reserve the right to make breaking changes from time to time as we make the pipeline more widely useful. However, the general pipeline infrastructure has been in production use since Kepler's launch in 2009.

### Resolved issues

In future releases, this section will contain a list of GitHub/Jira issues that were resolved and incorporated into the release. If the resolution for an issue introduced a breaking change, it will be described so that you can update your properties files or pipeline configurations in advance.

## 0.1.0

This release was overtaken by events. This release came and went before we got authorization to push our code to GitHub.
