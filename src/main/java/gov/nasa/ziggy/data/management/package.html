    The data management package provides support for all datastore operations.
    The heart of the package is the DataFileManager class, which has the main
    responsibility for identifying the datastore files needed as inputs for a
    given pipeline task, providing them to the task directory, and later collecting
    and persisting results from each task directory. The data management package
    also handles data receipt (the initial import of data files into the datastore).
    The DataFileType defines the regular expressions that allow the DataFileManager
    to identify a given file as belonging to a specified data file type.
