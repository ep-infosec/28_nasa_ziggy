    Supports Ziggy operations on instrument models. Instrument models generally 
    represent information on the state of the instruments used to acquire the
    data processed by Ziggy. Examples include calibration constants; values of
    position, velocity, attitude, and/or pointing; descriptions of instrument
    geometry; etc. Ziggy provides version control and data accountability for
    models used in data analysis.
