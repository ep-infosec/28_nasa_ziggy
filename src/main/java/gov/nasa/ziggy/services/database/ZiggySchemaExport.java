/**
 * This class provides a command-line interface to the Hibernate {@link SchemaExport} class which
 * uses {@link ZiggyHibernateConfiguration} as the configuration source.
 * <p>
 * Why didn't I just use the standard hbm2ddl ant task (which calls SchemaExport directly) to do
 * this instead of writing custom code to do it? Because the standard tools assume you have a
 * hibernate.cfg.xml file that explicitly lists all of your entity class. Rather than deal with that
 * maintenence headache, I wrote my own configurator {@link ZiggyHibernateConfiguration} which scans
 * the classpath for classes with Hibernate annotations and adds them to the configuration
 * dynamically. Hibernate does provide some similar code that scans the classpath, but it is
 * designed to work with JPA-style configuration files (persistence.xml) which has to be bundled in
 * a jar file, so it's difficult to support multiple database configurations.
