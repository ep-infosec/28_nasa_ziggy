/**
 * Worker end of two-way communication between the worker process and clients. The worker end plays
 * the role of the server in that it establishes the RMI registry used for the communication. It
 * also provides a method that broadcasts messages to all clients, each of which supplies a
 * {@link MessageHandlerService} stub when it initializes its own {@link UiCommunicator} instance.
 * <p>
 * The singleton {@link WorkerCommunicator} is created when the {@link WorkerPipelineProcess} is
 * created. At the same time a new {@link Thread} is created that periodically broadcasts instances
 * of the {@link WorkerHeartbeatMessage} to all clients. Both that thread and the
 * {@link WorkerCommunicator} instance are destroyed when the {@link WorkerPipelineProcess} exits.
 * The shutdown will also attempt to shut down the RMI registry (see below).
 * <p>
 * In the event that the {@link WorkerPipelineProcess} crashes, a new instance of the latter will be
 * created, along with new instances of the {@link WorkerCommunicator} and the heartbeat thread. In
 * this case, since the RMI registry is (probably) still running, the new instance of
 * {@link WorkerCommunicator} will attempt to connect to the registry and update the contents of
 * same. In this event, shutting down the {@link WorkerCommunicator} will not shut down the RMI
 * registry; it is impossible to shut down a registry if the process that created it has been lost.
 * Fortunately, shutting down the worker will eventually cause the registry to shut down as well.
